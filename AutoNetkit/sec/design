read the yamlfile from askar
write out the rpki.conf files together with identity files
work out which databases need to be created

databases are created in advance, but then only talked to by the daemons
we are not going to run the daemons on the creating machine

present files and startup scripts to askar
startup script needs to indicate
	which daemons to run
	which databases to create

daemons create tables, but databases are created first

ports:
rootd 4401
pubd 4402
irdbd 4403
rpkid 4404



answer:
	single script
	-m/--machine- parameter
		this is single machine mode and is to be run on the machine after deployment
		it will create database and start daemons and run the post daemon starting commands
	with out -m
		this is setup mode and will be run on the machine that runs autonetkit
		this will create all the identities upto but not running the daemons
		and tar up the files for the remote machine
